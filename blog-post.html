                    <h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>
                    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
                        the
                        industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of
                        type
                        and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
                        the
                        leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the
                        1960s
                        with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with
                        desktop
                        publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
                    <h1>Where does it come from?</h1>
                    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
                        classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a
                        Latin
                        professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
                        consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
                        literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and
                        1.10.33
                        of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC.
                        This
                        book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line
                        of
                        Lorem Ipsum, <u>"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",</u> comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
                        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested.
                        Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced
                        in
                        their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.
                        Rackham.

                    <blockquote>

                            The original print text, For 50 years, Lorem ipsum has been protecting the future of
                            nature. The world's leading conservation organization, Lorem ipsum works in 100 countries
                            and is
                            supported by 1.2 million members in the United States and close to 5 million globally.

                    <h1>Where can I get some?</h1>
                    <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered
                        alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly
                        believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't
                        anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the
                        Internet
                        tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the
                        Internet.
                        It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence
                        structures,
                        to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always
                        free
                        from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
